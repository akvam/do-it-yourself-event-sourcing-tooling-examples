Code generation of message classes
==================================

Speed up your start by generating message classes. 

How to run it?
--------------

You can compile the message classes by running `bin/compile.sh`. 

Why is the generated code so ugly?
----------------------------------

Our IDE will make it beautiful before we commit to the repo. 

Installation
------------

All required dependencies have been committed to the repository. However, you can use `bin/install.sh` in the event you wish to re-install the third-
party dependencies.
